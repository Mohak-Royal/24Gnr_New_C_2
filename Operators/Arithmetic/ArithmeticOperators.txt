Operators : operators are the symbols which are used to perform
	    operations in our program
	    
	    operations : addition , multiplication , comparision.....
	    
	    
-Types of Operators:

	-Arithmetic Operator
	-Relational Operator
	-Logical Operator
	-Unary Operator
	-Assignment Operator
	-Conditional Operator
	-Bitwise Operator
	
	
	
	Operand = Variables
	
	
	1. Arithmetic Operator : These are the Types of Operators which are used to perform mathematical Operations.
	-In Arithmetic operator we have two operand and one operator in the middle of the operands
	
	
	-Addition : +
		- it is used to add or sum two operands
		- Syntax: operand1 + operand2
		- Example : 			
			int a = 10 , b = 20 , sum;
			
			//printf("%d",a+b);
			//output : 30
			
			sum = a+b;
			printf("%d" , sum);
	
	-Subtraction : -
		-it is used to subtract or minus two operands
		- Syntax :  operand1 - operand2
		- Example:
			int a = 20 , b = 10 , sub;
			
			//printf("%d",a-b);
			//output : 10
			
			sub = a-b;
			printf("%d" , sum);
			output : 10
		
	-Multiplication : *
		-it is used to multiply or product of two operands
		- Syntax: operand1 * operand2
		- Example: 
			int a = 20 , b = 10 , ans;
			
			//printf("%d" , a*b);
			//output : 200
	
			ans = a*b;
			printf("%d" , ans);
			output : 200
	
	-Division : /
		-it is used to Divide two operands
		- it given quotient of the division
		- Syntax: operand1 / operand2
		- Example: 
			int a = 20 , b = 10 , div;
			
			//printf("%d" , a/b);
			//output : 2
	
			div = a/b;
			printf("%d" , div);
			output : 2		
	
	-Modulus : %
		-it is used to modulus two operands
		- it given remainder of the division
		- Syntax: operand1 % operand2
		- Example: 
			int a = 20 , b = 10 , mod;
			
			//printf("%d" , a%b);
			//output : 0 
	
			mod = a%b;
			printf("%d" , mod);
			output : 0
